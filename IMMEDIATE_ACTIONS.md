## Quick Wins (Next 3-5 Days)

### 1. WebGPU Backend Prototype
**Time:** 4-6 hours
```bash
# Spike task: Validate WebGPU can accelerate training
- Create simple matmul benchmark (CPU vs GPU)
- Measure speedup on sample training loop
- Document browser compatibility findings
```

**Files to explore:**
- `src/backend/webgpu.ts:1` (11K lines - identify key functions)
- `src/lib/ProNeuralLM.ts:1` (integration points)

**Success criteria:**
- Proof of 2-5x speedup on compatible hardware
- Clear path to integration identified

---

### 2. Transformer Quick Integration
**Time:** 6-8 hours
```bash
# Goal: Make transformer trainable via UI
- Review mini_transformer.ts completeness
- Add architecture selector to TrainingPanel
- Wire transformer to training loop
- Test on small corpus (100 samples)
```

**Files to modify:**
- `src/models/mini_transformer.ts:1`
- `src/components/TrainingPanel.tsx:1`
- `src/lib/AdvancedNeuralLM.ts:1`

**Success criteria:**
- User can select "Transformer" architecture in UI
- Training completes without errors
- Model artifact saved successfully

---

### 3. Edge Learning Diagnostics Demo
**Time:** 2-3 hours
```bash
# Goal: Connect Python edge learning to trained model
- Run on_the_edge_learning.py on existing model
- Capture efficiency metrics
- Display in terminal or simple UI
```

**Files to explore:**
- `symmetry_coupling/on_the_edge_learning.py:1`
- `models/neuro-lingua-v324.json:1` (latest trained model)

**Commands to run:**
```bash
# Test edge learning on existing model
cd symmetry_coupling
python on_the_edge_learning.py ../data/corpus.txt --model ../models/neuro-lingua-v324.json

# Expected output: Fisher information, efficiency bounds, bias decomposition
```

**Success criteria:**
- Script executes successfully
- Metrics computed and interpretable
- Clear path to UI integration identified

## This Sprint (Next 2 Weeks)

### Phase 1: Core Integration (40-60 hours)

#### Week 1
- [ ] **Day 1-2:** Complete WebGPU integration prototype
- [ ] **Day 3-4:** Transformer architecture fully functional in UI
- [ ] **Day 5:** Edge learning diagnostics connected to ModelMetrics

#### Week 2
- [ ] **Day 6-7:** WebGPU performance testing and fallback logic
- [ ] **Day 8-9:** Transformer comparison experiments (vs ProNeuralLM)
- [ ] **Day 10:** Documentation update, commit Phase 1

---

## Validation Checklist

Before moving to Phase 2, ensure:
- [ ] WebGPU toggle works in UI, graceful fallback tested
- [ ] Transformer training produces reasonable perplexity (<100 on sample data)
- [ ] Edge learning metrics displayed alongside standard metrics
- [ ] All existing tests still pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline green
- [ ] README updated with new features

---

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required
- Node.js 18+ (for `tsx` to run TypeScript scripts)
- Python 3.9+ (for edge learning scripts)
- Browser with WebGPU support (Chrome 113+, Edge 113+)

### Optional
- GPU with WebGPU support (for acceleration testing)
- Hebrew corpus (for multilingual experiments)

### Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
pip install datasets requests  # For data pipeline

# Verify setup
npm test                       # Should show 74+ tests passing
npm run build                  # Should complete without errors
```

## Measurement Plan

### Track These Metrics Weekly
1. **WebGPU Performance:**
   - Training time (CPU vs GPU)
   - Browser compatibility rate
   - Memory usage

2. **Transformer Quality:**
   - Perplexity (WikiText test set)
   - Training time vs ProNeuralLM
   - Model size

3. **Edge Learning Insights:**
   - Efficiency bounds computed
   - Correlation with generalization
   - Computational overhead

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups (5 min)
- What I completed yesterday
- What I'm working on today
- Any blockers

### Weekly Review (30 min)
- Demo working features
- Review metrics against targets
- Adjust priorities if needed

### Sprint Retrospective (1 hour)
- What went well
- What could improve
- Action items for next sprint

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If WebGPU Integration Blocked
**Fallback:** Proceed with Transformer + Edge Learning
**Reason:** WebGPU is additive, not critical path

### If Transformer Integration Complex
**Fallback:** Start with smaller model (2 layers, 4 heads)
**Reason:** Prove concept before scaling up

### If Edge Learning Script Fails
**Fallback:** Mock metrics in UI, fix integration later
**Reason:** UI work can proceed independently

---

## Success Signals

### You're on track if:
- WebGPU prototype shows measurable speedup by Day 3
- Transformer trains successfully by Day 5
- Edge metrics displayed in UI by Day 7
- All three features documented by Day 10

### You're blocked if:
- No browser supports WebGPU (unlikely)
- Transformer forward pass produces NaN (debug numerical stability)
- Edge learning script errors (check Python environment)

**Escalation:** If blocked >1 day, document issue and move to next priority

## Post-Phase 1 Decision Point

After completing immediate actions, evaluate:
1. **User Impact:** Which feature generates most interest?
2. **Technical Debt:** Any critical issues to address before Phase 2?
3. **Research Value:** Which experiments would be most insightful?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** Continue to Phase 2 (Research Validation)
- **Option B:** Polish Phase 1 features based on feedback
- **Option C:** Prioritize different feature (e.g., explainability)

**Decision Criteria:**
- User engagement with new features
- Technical stability of integrations
- Research questions ready to validate
