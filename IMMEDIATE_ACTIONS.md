# Immediate Action Plan

**Priority:** Start This Week
**Updated:** 2025-10-29 (Revised after Phase 1 analysis)

## Phase 1 Progress Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed: Edge Learning Diagnostics (2-3 hours)

**Implementation Time:** 2.5 hours

**What was delivered:**

- Created `src/lib/edgeDiagnostics.ts` (177 lines) - Node.js wrapper for Python edge learning script
- Integrated with `symmetry_coupling/on_the_edge_learning.py`
- Added "Edge Learning Diagnostics" section to ModelMetrics panel
- Displays: Average Efficiency, Edge Band %, Fisher Info, Flat Region status
- Color-coded interpretation with actionable insights
- Test suite: `tests/edgeDiagnostics.test.ts` (70 lines)

**Impact:**

- Users can now assess if trained models operate at the "edge of efficiency"
- Validates information-theoretic predictions from research papers
- Provides insights on generalization capability
- Immediate research value without code complexity

**Files modified:**

- `src/lib/edgeDiagnostics.ts` (new)
- `src/components/ModelMetrics.tsx` (added section)
- `tests/edgeDiagnostics.test.ts` (new)

**Git commit:** `b5e7855` - "Add edge learning diagnostics integration"

### üîç Analyzed: WebGPU Backend Integration

**Estimated Effort:** 36-52 hours (~1-1.5 weeks full-time)

**Findings:**

- Existing `src/backend/webgpu.ts` has solid foundation (380 lines)
- Missing: Activation derivatives, backprop, optimizers, loss functions
- Requires refactoring entire training loop from JS arrays to GPU tensors
- High numerical risk (subtle bugs in gradient computation)
- Expected speedup: 2-5x on compatible hardware

**Decision:** **Deferred to Phase 2** due to high complexity and time investment

See `docs/integration-complexity-analysis.md` for detailed breakdown.

---

### üîç Analyzed: Transformer Architecture Integration

**Estimated Effort:** 41-56 hours (~1-1.5 weeks full-time)

**Findings:**

- Existing components (`attention.ts`, `mini_transformer.ts`) are building blocks only
- Missing: Complete TransformerLM class, multi-layer backprop, embedding layer, training loop
- Requires implementing full transformer language model from scratch
- Medium complexity, well-understood architecture

**Decision:** **Deferred to Phase 2** due to significant implementation work required

See `docs/integration-complexity-analysis.md` for detailed breakdown.

   - **Mitigation:** Defer to dedicated sprint with 1-1.5 week allocation
2. **Feature Fragmentation**: Many partial implementations
   - **Mitigation:** Focus on completing 2-3 features well vs starting many
3. **Documentation Debt**: Advanced features undocumented
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize documentation sprint this week
